Tell me, for the love of God!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, my boy, it is arsenate of soda again.&rdquo;</p><p>Rouletabille, stricken to the heart, uttered a low cry and everything seemed to dance around him. Pere Alexis in the midst of all the strange laboratory instruments seemed Satan himself, and he repulsed the kindly arms stretched forth to sustain him; in the gloom, where danced here and there the little blue flames from the crucibles, lively as flickering tongues, he believed he saw Michael Nikolaievitch&rsquo;s ghost come to cry, &ldquo;The arsenate of soda continues, and I am dead.&rdquo; He fell against the door, which swung open, and he rolled as far as the counter, and struck his face against it. The shock, that might well have been fatal, brought him out of his intense nightmare and made him instantly himself again.</p></div> </div>
