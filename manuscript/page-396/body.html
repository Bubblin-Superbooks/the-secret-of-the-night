We are invited by Gounsovski himself. Don&rsquo;t forget that, if stories concerning it drift about some day, my friends,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.</p><p>&ldquo;For that matter, Thaddeus, I accept the invitation of the honorable chief of our admirable Secret Service because I don&rsquo;t wish to slight him. I have dined at his house already. By sitting opposite him at a public table here I feel that I return that politeness. What do you say to that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Since you have dined with him, tell us what kind of a man he is aside from his fattish qualities,&rdquo; said the curious councilor. &ldquo;So many things are said about him. He certainly seems to be a man it is better to stand in with than to fall out with, so I accept his invitation. How could you manage to refuse it, anyway?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
