But how did you do that when you never entered the general&rsquo;s chamber until to-night?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Doubtless, but I went up that servants&rsquo; staircase much earlier than that. And I will tell you why. When I was brought into the villa the first time, and you watched me, bidden behind the door, do you know what I was watching myself, while I appeared to be solely occupied digging out the caviare? The fresh print of boot-nails which left the carpet near the table, where someone had spilled beer (the beer was still running down the cloth). Someone had stepped in the beer. The boot-print was not clearly visible excepting there.</p></div> </div>
