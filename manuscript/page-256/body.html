No, at first, what is it that makes you believe&mdash;good God!&mdash;that someone will return by that door? How can you see that, all that, in a poor little hat-pin?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Madame, it is not a single hat-pin hole; there are two of them.</p><p>&ldquo;Two hat-pin holes?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
