<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I will understand you, perhaps, when you have explained to me how Natacha has not poisoned her father and step-mother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There are some things so simple, Sire, that one is able to think of them only with a rope around one&rsquo;s neck. But let us reason it out. We have here four persons, two of whom have been poisoned and the other two with them have not been. Now, it is certain that, of the four persons, the general has not wished to poison himself, that his wife has not wished to poison the general, and that, as for me, I have not wished to poison anybody. That, if we are absolutely sure of it, leaves as the poisoner only Natacha. That is so certain, so inevitable, that there is only one case, one alone, where, in such conditions, Natacha would not be regarded as the poisoner.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
