She waited for what he should say. She felt no fear. Yet she had supposed he was outside the house. Still, after all, she was not too astonished that he was within. He was so adroit! He had entered behind her, in the shadow of her skirts, on all-fours, and had slipped away without anyone noticing him, while she was speaking to her enormous, majestic schwitzar.</p><p>&ldquo;So you were here?&rdquo; she said, taking his hand and pressing it nervously in hers.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. I have watched you closing the house. It is a task well-done, certainly. You have not forgotten anything.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
