<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The Tsar is not satisfied. And, within an hour, my men will return to assume their guard at the datcha.&rdquo;</p><p>Rouletabille listened to the end. No one ever had spoken to him in that tone. He was red, and as ready to burst as a child&rsquo;s balloon blown too hard. He said:</p><p>&ldquo;And I will take the train this evening.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, and you can guard your general all alone. I have had enough of it. Ah, you are not satisfied! Ah, the Tsar is not satisfied! It is too bad. No more of it for me. Monsieur, I am not satisfied, and I say Good-evening to you. Only do not forget to send me from here every three or four days a letter which will keep me informed of the health of the general, whom I love dearly. I will offer up a little prayer for him.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
