<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;My dear Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille, if it will not inconvenience you, I wish you would come and dine with me to-day. I will look for you within two hours. Madame Gounsovski will be pleased to make your acquaintance. Believe me your devoted Gounsovski.&rdquo;</p><p>Rouletabille considered, and decided:</p><p>&ldquo;I will go. He ought to have wind of what is being plotted, and as for me, I don&rsquo;t know where Annouchka has gone. I have more to learn from him than he has from me. Besides, as Athanase Georgevitch said, one may regret not accepting the Head of the Okrana&rsquo;s pleasant invitation.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
