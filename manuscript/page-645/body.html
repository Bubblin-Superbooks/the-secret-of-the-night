Suddenly he turned his head at a singular noise. At first he didn&rsquo;t see anything, but heard in the distance a vague clamoring while a sort of vapor commenced to rise from the marsh. And then he noticed, nearer him, the high marsh grasses undulating. Finally he saw a countless flock rising from the bed of the marshes. Beasts, groups of beasts, whose horns one saw like bayonets, jostled each other trying to keep to the firm land.

Rouletabille stopped short before this prehistoric invasion.</p></div> </div>
