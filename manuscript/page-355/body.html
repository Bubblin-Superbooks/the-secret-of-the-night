<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;It is true. You can&rsquo;t do me as much harm as I have done you, whether you think so or not. All the harm that can be done me by you and yours is already accomplished. My name is not Touman, but Matiev. Listen. I had a son that was the light of my eyes. Neither my son nor I had ever been concerned with politics. I was employed in Moscow. My son was a student. During the Red Week we went out, my son and I, to see a little of what was happening over in the Presnia quarter. They said everybody had been killed over there! We passed before the Presnia gate. Soldiers called to us to stop because they wished to search us. We opened our coats. The soldiers saw my son&rsquo;s student waistcoat and set up a cry. They unbuttoned the vest, drew a note-book out of his pocket and they found a workman&rsquo;s song in it that had been published in the Signal. The soldiers didn&rsquo;t know how to read.</p></div> </div>
