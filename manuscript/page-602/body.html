<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Priemkof, a man with my entire confidence.&rdquo;</p><p>Koupriane&rsquo;s carriage rushed toward the Isles. Late evening had come. Alone on the deserted route the horses seemed headed for the stars; the carriage behind seemed no drag upon them. The coachman bent above them, arms out, as though he would spring into the ether. Ah, the beautiful night, the lovely, peaceful night beside the Neva, marred by the wild gallop of these maddened horses!</p><p>&ldquo;Priemkof! Priemkof! One of Gounsovski&rsquo;s men! I should have suspected him,&rdquo; railed Koupriane after Rouletabille&rsquo;s explanations. &ldquo;But now, shall we arrive in time?&rdquo;</p><p>They stood up in the carriage, urging the coachman, exciting the horses: &ldquo;Scan! Scan! Faster, douriak!&rdquo; Could they arrive before the &ldquo;living bombs&rdquo;? Could they hear them before they arrived? Ah, there was Eliaguine!</p></div> </div>
