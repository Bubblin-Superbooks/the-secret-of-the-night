<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Good Lord, yes, I have discovered something, Monsieur Koupriane. You don&rsquo;t suppose I have come so far to waste my time, do you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Something no one else knows?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Monsieur Koupriane, otherwise I shouldn&rsquo;t have troubled to feel concerned. Something I have not confided to anyone, not even to my note-book, because a note-book, you know, a note-book can always be lost. I just mention that in case you had any idea of having me searched before my departure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Monsieur Rouletabille!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eh, eh, like the way the police do in your country; in mine too, for that matter. Yes, that&rsquo;s often enough seen. The police, furious because they can&rsquo;t hit a clue in some case that interests them, arrest a reporter who knows more than they do, in order to make him talk. But&mdash;nothing of that sort with me, monsieur.</p></div> </div>
