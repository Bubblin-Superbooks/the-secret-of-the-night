The prince saluted him and ironically amused himself by inquiring:</p><p>&ldquo;Well, well, how do you do, my dear Monsieur Koupriane. Your Excellency has risen in good time this morning, it seems to me. Or else it is I who start for bed too late.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; said Koupriane, &ldquo;my men are in pursuit of a little Bohemian named Katharina, well known in the restaurants where she sings. We have seen her go into the Barque. Have you met her by any chance?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good Lord, Monsieur Koupriane, I am not the concierge of the Barque, and I have not noticed anything at all, and nobody. Besides, I am naturally a little sleepy. Pardon me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
