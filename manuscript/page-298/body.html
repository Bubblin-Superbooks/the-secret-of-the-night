<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I promise you. I will not pay any attention to her. That is promised. That is promised. Do as you please. Why, just now, when I spoke of the Nihilists to you, did you say, &lsquo;If it were only that!&rsquo;? You believe, then, that she is not a Nihilist? She reads such things&mdash;things like on the barricades...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Madame, madame, you think of nothing but Natacha. You have promised me not to watch her; promise me not to think about her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, why did you say, &lsquo;If it was only that!&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because, if there were only Nihilists in your affair, dear madame, it would be too simple, or, rather, it would have been more simple. Can you possibly believe, madame, that simply a Nihilist, a Nihilist who was only a Nihilist, would take pains that his bomb exploded from a vase of flowers?</p></div> </div>
