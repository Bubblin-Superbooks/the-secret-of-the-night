<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I shall have to remain a week still in the city. I have engaged a chamber at the Hotel de France. It is necessary. I have so many people to see and to receive. I will come to make you a little visit from time to time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are then quite easy,&rdquo; demanded the general gravely, &ldquo;at leaving me all alone?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Entirely easy. And, besides, I don&rsquo;t leave you all alone. I leave you with Madame Trebassof and Mademoiselle. I repeat: All three of you stay as I see you now. No more police, or, in any case, the fewest possible.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
