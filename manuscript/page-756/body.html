Rapidly, through the vast silent spaces, the little car glided over the lonely route into the black arms of the pines.</p><p>Rouletabille, holding on to his seat, looked about him.</p><p>&ldquo;God! this is as sad as a funeral display.&rdquo;</p><p>Little frozen huts, no larger than tombs, occasionally indicated the road, but there was no mark of life in that country except the noise of the journey and the two beasts with steaming coats.</p><p>Crack! One of the shafts broken. &ldquo;What a country!&rdquo; To hear Rouletabille one would suppose that only in Russia could the shaft of a carriage break.</p></div> </div>
