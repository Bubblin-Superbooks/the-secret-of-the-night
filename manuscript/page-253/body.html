<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;We have come to them now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And the bouquet attack, which is going to happen again? Why?

It was that way that the bomb was brought, and it is by that way that someone has prepared to return.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But how? You are sure the little hole is the way someone came? But what makes you think that is how they mean to return? You know well enough that, not having succeeded in the general&rsquo;s chamber, they are at work in the dining-room.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
