<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Monsieur, at the Chateau yesterday morning something happened that is perhaps more alarming than the letter found by Alexander II under his napkin.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What can it be? Have bombs been discovered?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. It is a bizarre occurrence and almost unbelievable. The eider downs, all the eider down coverings belonging to the imperial family disappeared yesterday morning.&rdquo; *</p><p>* Historically authentic.</p><p>&ldquo;Surely not!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is just as I say. And it was impossible to learn what had become of them&mdash;until yesterday evening, when they were found again in their proper places in the chambers. That is the new mystery!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
