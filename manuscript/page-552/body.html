<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The conveyance clattered over the pointed flints of a neighborhood that led to a little street, Aptiekarski-Pereoulok, at the corner of the Katharine canal. This &ldquo;alley of the pharmacists&rdquo; as a matter of fact contained no pharmacists, but there was a curious sign of a herbarium, where Rouletabille made the driver stop. As the carriage rolled under the arch Rouletabille recognized Koupriane. He did not wait, but cried to him, &ldquo;Ah, here you are. All right; follow me.&rdquo; He still had the flask and the glasses in his hands. Koupriane couldn&rsquo;t help noticing how strange he looked. He passed through a court with him, and into a squalid shop.</p><p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; said Koupriane, &ldquo;do you know Pere Alexis?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
