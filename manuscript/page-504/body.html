She had reached Kameny-Ostrow on the west bank. &ldquo;Oh, for a carriage, a horse!&rdquo; clamored Koupriane, who had left his turn-out at Eliaguine. &ldquo;The proof is there. It is the final proof of everything that is escaping us!&rdquo;</p><p>Dawn was enough advanced now to show the ground clearly. Katharina was easily discernible as she reached the Eliaguine bridge. There she was in Eliaguine-Ostrow. What was she doing there? Was she going to the Trebassof villa? What would she have to say to them? No, she swerved to the right. The police raced behind her. She was still far ahead, and seemed untiring. Then she disappeared among the trees, in the thicket, keeping still to the right. Koupriane gave a cry of joy. Going that way she must be taken.</p></div> </div>
