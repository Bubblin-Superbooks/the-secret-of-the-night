It is absolutely necessary that we know what happened to those grapes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Rouletabille, &ldquo;they could cause a catastrophe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If it has not happened already,&rdquo; fretted the marshal.</p><p>&ldquo;But how? Where are they? Whom did you give them to?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I carried them in a white cardboard box, the first one that came to hand in Doucet&rsquo;s place. I came here the first time and didn&rsquo;t find you. I returned again with the box, and the general was just lying down. I was pressed for my train and Michael Nikolaievitch and Boris Alexandrovitch were in the garden, so I asked them to execute my commission, and I laid the box down near them on the little garden table, telling them not to forget to tell you it was necessary to wash the grapes as Doucet expressly recommended.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
