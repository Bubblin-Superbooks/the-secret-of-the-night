<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Who is the fool that would dare compare a young gentleman who has well digested a bottle of champagne or two, and another young man who has poorly digested the lucubrations of, who shall we say?&mdash;the lucubrations of the economists? The economists? The economists! Fools who compete which can make the most violent statements! Those who read them and don&rsquo;t understand them go off like a bomb! Your health! Nichevo! The world goes round still, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p><p>Discussion political, economic, revolutionary, and other in the room where they munch hors-d&rsquo;oeuvres! You will hear it all as you pass through the hotel to your chamber, young Rouletabille. Get quickly now to the home of Koupriane, if you don&rsquo;t wish to arrive there at luncheon-time; then you would have to put off these serious affairs until evening.</p></div> </div>
