If you only knew how I suffered in your absence, I who know how unjust my daughter was to you. But dear Natacha knows now what she owes you. She doesn&rsquo;t doubt your word now, nor your clear intelligence, little angel. Michael Nikolaievitch was a monster and he was punished as he deserved. You know the police have proof now that he was one of the Central Revolutionary Committee&rsquo;s most dangerous agents. And he an officer! Whom can we trust now!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And Monsieur Boris Mourazoff, have you seen him since?&rdquo; inquired Rouletabille.</p></div> </div>
