But he had need to speak to Rouletabille in private, and he drew the reporter, after excuses, out into the corridor.</p><p>&ldquo;It is the Emperor himself who has sent me,&rdquo; said the high dignitary with emotion. &ldquo;He has sent me about the eider downs. You forgot to explain the eider downs to him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Niet!&rdquo; replied Rouletabille, laughing. &ldquo;That is nothing. Nitchevo! His Majesty&rsquo;s eider downs are of the finest eider, as one of the feathers that you have shown me demonstrates. Well, open them now. They are a cheap imitation, as the second feather proves. The return of the false eider downs, before evening, proves then that they hoped the substitution would pass undetected. That is all. Caracho! Collapse of the hoax. Your health! Vive le Tsar!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
