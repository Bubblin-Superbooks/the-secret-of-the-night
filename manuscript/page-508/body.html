Do you take me for one of your bloodhounds? They say you have them in all classes, but I insist that I haven&rsquo;t enlisted yet. You have made a mistake, Monsieur Koupriane.&rdquo;</p><p>The prince saluted again. But Koupriane still stood in his way.</p><p>&ldquo;Prince, consider that this matter is very serious. Michael Nikolaievitch, General Trebassof&rsquo;s orderly, is dead, and this little girl has stolen his papers from his body. All persons who have spoken with Katharina will be under suspicion. This is an affair of State, monsieur, which may reach very far. Can you swear to me that you have not seen, that you have not spoken to Katharina?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
