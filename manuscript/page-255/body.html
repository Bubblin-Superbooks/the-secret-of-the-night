That door has not been watched this afternoon. In our absence it could have been opened. If someone has placed a bomb during our absence!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is why I sent you at once in to the dining-room on that search that I thought would be fruitless, dear madame. And that is why I hurried upstairs to the bedroom. I went to the stairway door instantly. I had prepared for proof positive if anyone had pushed it open even half a millimeter. No, no one had touched the door in our absence.</p></div> </div>
