<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I always take my revolver when I go out,&rdquo; said Athanase. &ldquo;It is more prudent. I say this before the police. But I would rather be arrested by the police than stabbed by the hooligans.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no place any more to buy revolvers,&rdquo; declared Ivan Petrovitch. &ldquo;All such places are closed.&rdquo;</p><p>Gounsovski settled his glasses, rubbed his fat hands and said:</p><p>&ldquo;There are some still at my locksmith&rsquo;s place. The proof is that to-day in the little Kaniouche my locksmith, whose name is Smith, went into the house of the grocer at the corner and wished to sell him a revolver. It was a Browning. &lsquo;An arm of the greatest reliability,&rsquo; he said to him, &lsquo;which never misses fire and which works very easily.&rsquo; Having pronounced these words, the locksmith tried his revolver and lodged a ball in the grocer&rsquo;s lung.</p></div> </div>
