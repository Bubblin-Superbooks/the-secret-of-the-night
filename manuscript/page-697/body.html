<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Answer me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I couldn&rsquo;t be mistaken. The thing is as certain as that we two are here&mdash;arsenate of soda in the stains on the two napkins and traces of arsenate of soda in two of the four glasses; none in the carafe, none in the little bottle, none in the two glasses. I say it before you and before God.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So it is really true. Thank you, Alexis Hutch. Koupriane has not tried to deceive me. There has been nothing of that sort. Well, do you know, Alexis Hutch, who has poured the poison? It is she or I. And as it is not I, it is she. And since it is she, well, I am going to die!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
