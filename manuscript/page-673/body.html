Rouletabille stopped him.</p><p>&ldquo;Excellency, I wish you to tell me why you have shown such anger to your men just now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They are brute beasts,&rdquo; cried the Chief of Police, quite beside himself again. &ldquo;They have made me miss the biggest catch of my life. They threw themselves on the group two minutes too early. Some of them fired a gun that they took for the signal and that served to warn the Nihilists. But I will let them all rot in prison until I learn which one fired that shot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t look far for that,&rdquo; said Rouletabille. &ldquo;I did it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
