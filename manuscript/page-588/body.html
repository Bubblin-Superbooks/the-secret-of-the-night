<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; questioned Rouletabille, recalling with some inquietude the sight of the whipping in the guards&rsquo; chapel.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, this Priemkof, between ourselves,&rdquo; (and he bent close to the reporter&rsquo;s ear) &ldquo;is no better, as a police-guard for Koupriane than Matiew himself. Very dangerous. So when I learned that he took Matiew&rsquo;s place at the datcha des Iles, I thought there was sure to be some unfortunate happening. But it was no affair of mine, was it? Koupriane would have been able to say to me, &lsquo;Mind your own business.&rsquo; I had gone far enough in warning him of the &lsquo;living bombs.&rsquo; They had been denounced to us by the same agency that enabled us to seize the two living bombs (women, if you please!) who were going to the military tribunal at Cronstadt after the rebellion in the fleet. Let him recall that. That ought to make him reflect. I am a brave man.</p></div> </div>
