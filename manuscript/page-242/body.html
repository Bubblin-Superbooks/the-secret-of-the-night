The door of the servants&rsquo; stairway was condemned a long time ago; it has been locked by me, I alone have the key and on the inside of the door opening into the general&rsquo;s chamber there is also a bolt which is always shot. All the other doors of the chambers have been condemned by me.</p></div> </div>
