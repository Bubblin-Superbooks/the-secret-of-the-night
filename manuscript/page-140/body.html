Dear little monsieur, it is the secret of the night. The poor man! Poor unhappy man! He cannot tear his thoughts away from it. It is his worst and unmerited punishment, this translation that Natacha has made of Boris&rsquo;s abominable verses. He knows them by heart, they are in his brain and on his tongue all night long, in spite of narcotics, and he says over and over again all the time, &lsquo;It is my daughter who has written that!&mdash;my daughter!&mdash;my daughter!&rsquo; It is enough to wring all the tears from one&rsquo;s body&mdash;that an aide-de-camp of a general, who himself has killed the youth of Moscow, is allowed to write such verses and that Natacha should take it upon herself to translate them into lovely poetic French for her album. It is hard to account for what they do nowadays, to our misery.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
