<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Natacha is the friend of these precious men and we will see them disembark hand in hand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your men, then, haven&rsquo;t studied the traces of the struggle that &lsquo;these precious men&rsquo; have had on the banks of the Neva before they carried away Natacha?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, they haven&rsquo;t been hoodwinked.

Can&rsquo;t you see that Natacha&rsquo;s presence in the datcha had become quite too dangerous for that charming young girl after the poisoning of her father and step-mother failed and at the moment when her comrades were preparing to send General Trebassof a pleasant little gift of dynamite? She arranged to get away and yet to appear kidnapped. It is too simple.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
