One day a police agent came and invited me to dinner by command&mdash;or, at least, I understood it wasn&rsquo;t wise to refuse the invitation, as you said, Ivan Petrovitch. When I went to his house I thought I was entering a fortress, and inside I thought it must be an umbrella shop. There were umbrellas everywhere, and goloshes. True, it was a day of pouring rain. I was struck by there being no guard with a big revolver in the antechamber. He had a little, timid schwitzar there, who took my umbrella, murmuring &lsquo;barine&rsquo; and bowing over and over again. He conducted me through very ordinary rooms quite unguarded to an average sitting-room of a common kind.</p></div> </div>
