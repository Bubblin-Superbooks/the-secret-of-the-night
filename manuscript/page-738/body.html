<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;How is that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is because I was sick, you see&mdash;very seriously sick. That affair of Michael Nikolaievitch and the poison that still continued after he was dead simply robbed me of all my powers. Now that I am sure I have not been the means of killing an innocent man&mdash;I am Rouletabille again! It is not possible that I shall not find the way, that I shall not see through this mystery.&rdquo;</p><p>The terrible voice of the Christ-like figure said monotonously:</p><p>&ldquo;Do your duty, messieurs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pardon, pardon. This is of great importance to you&mdash;and the proof is that you have not yet hanged me. You were not so procrastinating with my predecessor, were you? You have listened to me because you have hoped! Very well, let me think, let me consider.</p></div> </div>
