<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> You can imagine the scandal, for the student was dead! There were Paris journalists there, besides, who had never been there before, you see! Monsieur Gaston Leroux was at that very table. What a scandal! They had a regular battle. They broke carafes over the head of the assassin&mdash;for he was neither more nor less than an assassin, a drinker of blood&mdash;an Asiatic. They picked up the assassin, who was bleeding all over, and carried him off to look after him. As to the dead man, he lay stretched out there under a table-cloth, waiting for the police&mdash;and those at the tables went on with their drinking. Isn&rsquo;t that Asiatic enough for you? Here, a naked woman; there, a corpse! And the jewels&mdash;and the champagne! What do you say to that?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
