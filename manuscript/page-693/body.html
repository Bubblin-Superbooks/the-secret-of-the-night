<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Soup. His Majesty is wonderfully fond of soup. He takes it at every meal. After luncheon he smokes, but never a cigar&mdash;always cigarettes, gifts of the Sultan; and he only drinks one liqueur, Maraschino. At half-past two he goes out again for a little air&mdash;always in his park; then he sets himself to work until eight o&rsquo;clock. It is simply frightful work, with heaps of useless papers and numberless signatures. No secretary can spare him that ungrateful bureaucratic duty. He must sign, sign, sign, and read, read, read the reports. And it is work without any beginning or end; as soon as some reports go, others arrive. At eight o&rsquo;clock, dinner, and then more signatures, working right up to eleven o&rsquo;clock. At eleven o&rsquo;clock he goes to bed.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
