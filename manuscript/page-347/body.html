<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But among those Apaches don&rsquo;t send that agent of your Secret Service who watched the window while the assassin climbed to it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, these climbs that you can read the proofs of on the wall and on the iron forgings of the balcony went on while your agents, night and day, were watching the villa. Have you noticed, monsieur, that it was always the same agent who took the post at night, behind the villa, under the window? General Trebassof&rsquo;s book in which he kept a statement of the exact disposal of each of your men during the period of siege was most instructive on that point. The other posts changed in turn, but the same agent, when he was among the guard, demanded always that same post, which was not disputed by anybody, since it is no fun to pass the hours of the night behind a wall, in an empty field.</p></div> </div>
