That anxiety you speak of never leaves me. Whenever I have the chance I examine the flooring.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; demanded the young man, &ldquo;what was your daughter doing in this room?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She came for a glass of mineral water; the bottle is still on the table.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Madame, it is necessary that you tell me precisely what Koupriane has only hinted to me, unless I am entirely mistaken. The first time that you thought to examine the floor, was it after you heard a noise on the ground-floor such as has just happened?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
