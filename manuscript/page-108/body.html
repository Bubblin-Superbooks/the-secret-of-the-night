<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;But where were you, dear little demon? I have been into all the corners, and my hands did not touch you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was under the table set with hors-d&rsquo;oeuvres in the sitting-room.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, under the table of zakouskis! I have forbidden them before now to spread a long hanging cloth there, which obliges me to kick my foot underneath casually in order to be sure there is no one beneath. It is imprudent, very imprudent, such table-cloths. And under the table of zakouskis have you been able to see or hear anything?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Madame, do you think that anyone could possibly see or hear anything in the villa when you are watching it alone, when the general is asleep and your step-daughter is preparing for bed?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
