It is a mother that I lost the day of my birth and that I have found again, but&mdash;I suppose it is to be said&mdash;on the day of my death. I shall not see her again. I have a friend; I shall not see him again either. I have two little ikons here for them, and I am going to write a letter to each of them, if you will permit it. Swear to me that you will see these reach them.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
