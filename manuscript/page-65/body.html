<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;He sleeps now, then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. Koupriane has him shut in the lodge to keep him from barking nights. Koupriane fears that if he is out he will devour one of the police who watch in the garden at night. I wanted him to sleep in the house, or by his master&rsquo;s door, or even at the foot of the bed, but Koupriane said, &lsquo;No, no; no dog. Don&rsquo;t rely on the dog. Nothing is more dangerous than to rely on the dog. &lsquo;Since then he has kept Khor locked up at night. But I do not understand Koupriane&rsquo;s idea.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Koupriane is right,&rdquo; said the reporter. &ldquo;Dogs are useful only against strangers.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
