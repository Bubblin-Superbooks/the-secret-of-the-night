<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> We dined with Madame Gounsovski, who appeared fattish like her husband, and three or four men whom I had never seen anywhere. One servant waited on us. My word!</p><p>&ldquo;At dessert Gounsovski took me aside and told me I was unwise to &lsquo;argue that way.&rsquo; I asked him what he meant by that. He took my hands between his fat hands and repeated, &lsquo;No, no, it is not wise to argue like that.&rsquo; I couldn&rsquo;t draw anything else out of him. For that matter, I understood him, and, you know, since that day I have cut out certain side passages unnecessary in my general law pleadings that had been giving me a reputation for rather too free opinions in the papers. None of that at my age! Ah, the great Gounsovski! Over our coffee I asked him if he didn&rsquo;t find the country in pretty strenuous times.</p></div> </div>
