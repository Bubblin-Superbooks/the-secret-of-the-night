But have you any news of the sufferers? Apropos, rather a curious thing has happened. I met Kister on the Nevsky just now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The physician?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, one of Trebassof&rsquo;s physicians whom I had sent an inspector to his house to fetch to the datcha, as well as his usual associate, Doctor Litchkof. Well, neither Litchkof nor he had been summoned. They didn&rsquo;t know anything had happened at the datcha. They had not seen my inspector. I hope he has met some other doctor on the way and, in view of the urgency, has taken him to the datcha.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
