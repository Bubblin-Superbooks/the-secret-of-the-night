<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I have no desire to know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eh, yes. It necessarily is Natacha. I was sure that the Villa des Iles had its viper. I tell you she doesn&rsquo;t dare leave her nest because she knows she is watched. Not one of her movements outside escapes us! She knows it. She has been warned. The last time she ventured outside alone was to go into the old quarters of Derewnia. What has she to do in such a rotten quarter? I ask you that. And she turned in her tracks without seeing anyone, without knocking at a single door, because she saw that she was followed. She isn&rsquo;t able to get to see them outside, therefore she has to see them inside.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
