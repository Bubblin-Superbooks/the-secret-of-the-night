Why do you beat him?&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Because he has told us he is a dangerous student.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That is no reason,&rsquo; Feodor told him. &lsquo;He will be shot if he deserves it, and the child also, but I forbid you to beat him. You have not been furnished with these whips in order to beat isolated prisoners, but to charge the crowd when it does not obey the governor&rsquo;s orders. In such a case you are ordered &ldquo;Charge,&rdquo; and you know what to do. You understand?&rsquo; Feodor said roughly. &lsquo;I am General Trebassof, your governor.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
