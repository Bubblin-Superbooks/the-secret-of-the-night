How did you know him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;First, he wore glasses. All Nihilists wear glasses when traveling. And then I had a good clew. A minute before the departure from Paris I had a friend go into the corridor of the sleeping-car, a reporter who would do anything I said without even wanting to know why. I said, &lsquo;You call out suddenly and very loud, &ldquo;Hello, here is Rouletabille.&rdquo;&rsquo; So he called, &lsquo;Hello, here is Rouletabille,&rsquo; and all those who were in the corridor turned and all those who were already in the compartments came out, excepting the man with the glasses. Then I was sure about him.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
