You know, Feodor, that he smokes his pipe just like the dear little porcelain domovoi.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He does resemble him, he certainly does,&rdquo; said Feodor. &ldquo;That makes us feel happy, but I wish him to sleep also.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; smiled Rouletabille, &ldquo;everybody will sleep here. That is the countersign. We have watched enough. Since the police are gone we can all sleep, believe me, general.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
