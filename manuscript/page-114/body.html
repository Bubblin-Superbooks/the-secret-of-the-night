<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand? It is so that we shall be able to hear the tick-tack better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I understand. But I do not hear anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For myself, I think I hear the tick-tack all the time since the last attempt. It haunts my ears, it is frightful, to say to one&rsquo;s self: There is clockwork somewhere, just about to reach the death-tick&mdash;and not to know where, not to know where! When the police were here I made them all listen, and I was not sure even when they had all listened and said there was no tick-tack. It is terrible to hear it in my ear any moment when I least expect it. Tick-tack! Tick-tack! It is the blood beating in my ear, for instance, hard, as if it struck on a sounding-board. Why, here are drops of perspiration on my hands! Listen!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
