A little before luncheon she had held a double conversation in the garden with Michael and Boris. No one ever could have known what these three young people had said if some stenographic notes in Rouletabille&rsquo;s memorandum-book did not give us a notion; the reporter had overheard, by accident surely, since all self-respecting reporters are quite incapable of eavesdropping.</p><p>The memorandum notes:</p><p>Natacha went into the garden with a book, which she gave to Boris, who pressed her hand lingeringly to his lips. &ldquo;Here is your book; I return it to you. I don&rsquo;t want any more of them, the ideas surge so in my brain. It makes my head ache. It is true, you are right, I don&rsquo;t love novelties. I can satisfy myself with Pouchkine perfectly. The rest are all one to me. Did you pass a good night?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
