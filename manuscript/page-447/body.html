Annouchka turned her head as though to arrange the folds of her cloak. Galitch contented himself with shrugging his shoulders impatiently and murmuring:</p><p>&ldquo;Still some other abomination that you are concocting, monsieur, and that we don&rsquo;t know how to reply to.&rdquo;</p><p>After which he bowed to the supper-party, took Annouchka&rsquo;s arm and had her move before him. Gounsovski bowed, almost bent in two. When he rose he saw before him the three astounded and horrified figures of Thaddeus Tchitchnikoff, Ivan Petrovitch and Athanase Georgevitch.</p><p>&ldquo;Messieurs,&rdquo; he said to them, in a colorless voice which seemed not to belong to him, &ldquo;the time has come for us to part. I need not say that we have supped as friends and that, if you wish it to be so, we can forget everything that has been said here.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
