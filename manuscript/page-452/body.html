The dancer caught him on her knees.</p><p>&ldquo;To Eliaguine, fast as you can,&rdquo; cried the reporter for all explanation.</p><p>&ldquo;Scan! Scan! (Quickly, quickly)&rdquo; repeated Onoto.</p><p>She was accompanied by a vague sort of person to whom neither of them paid the least attention.</p><p>&ldquo;What a supper! You waked up at last, did you?&rdquo; quizzed the actress. But Rouletabille, standing up behind the enormous coachman, urged the horses and directed the route of the carriage.
