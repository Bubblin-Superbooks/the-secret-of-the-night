<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> You notice that this enormous dining hall is surrounded by those windowed balconies. Each of those windows belongs to a separate private room. Well, you see that window there?&mdash;yes, there&mdash;that is the room of a grand duke&mdash;yes, he&rsquo;s the one I mean&mdash;a very gay grand duke. Do you know, one evening when there was a great crowd here&mdash;families, monsieur, family parties, high-born families&mdash;the window of that particular balcony was thrown open, and a woman stark naked, as naked as my hand, monsieur, was dropped into the dining-hall and ran across it full-speed. It was a wager, monsieur, a wager of the jolly grand duke&rsquo;s, and the demoiselle won it. But what a scandal! Ah, don&rsquo;t speak of it; that would be very bad form. But&mdash;sufficiently Asiatic, eh? Truly Asiatic.</p></div> </div>
