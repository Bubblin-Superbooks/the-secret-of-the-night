Matrena Petrovna was sure of Natacha&rsquo;s complicity in Michael Nikolaievitch&rsquo;s attempt to poison the general. I shared her stupor, her despair, when Feodor Feodorovitch took his daughter in his arms after that tragic night, and embraced her. He seemed to absolve her. It was then that Matrena resolved within herself to save the general in spite of himself, but I remain persuaded that, if she had dared such a plan against Natacha, it would only be because of what she believed definite proof of her step-daughter&rsquo;s infamy. These papers, Sire, that you have shown me, and which show, if nothing more, an understanding between Natacha and the revolutionaries, could only have been in the possession of Michael or of Natacha. Nothing was found in Michael&rsquo;s quarters. Tell me, then, that Matrena found them in Natacha&rsquo;s apartment. Then, she did not hesitate!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
