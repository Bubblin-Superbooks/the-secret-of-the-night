It may be that before death came he had time to hear Annouchka cry to him, &ldquo;Wretch! You were told to kill the prince, not to assassinate his children.&rdquo; As it happened, Peter Alexandrovitch held on his knees the two little princesses, seven and eight years old. The Court had wished to recompense her for that heroic act. Annouchka had spit at the envoy of the Chief of Police who called to speak to her of money. At the Hermitage in Moscow, where she sang then, some of her admirers had warned her of possible reprisals on the part of the revolutionaries.
