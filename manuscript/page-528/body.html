<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Boris called to see us to-day, to say good-by, but we did not receive him, under the orders of the police. Natacha has written to tell him of Koupriane&rsquo;s orders. We have received letters from him; he is quitting St. Petersburg.</p><p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, after the frightful bloody scene in his little house, when he learned how Michael Nikolaievitch had found his death, and after he himself had undergone a severe grilling from the police, and when he learned the police had sacked his library and gone through his papers, he resigned, and has resolved to live from now on out in the country, without seeing anyone, like the philosopher and poet he is. So far as I am concerned, I think he is doing absolutely right. When a young man is a poet, it is useless to live like a soldier.</p></div> </div>
