Don&rsquo;t be uneasy; let everybody have the good news.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I will tell only the general and his friends, you may be sure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now, dear Madame, just one more word. Do not wait for me at luncheon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What! You are going to leave us?&rdquo; she cried instantly, breathless. &ldquo;No, no. I do not wish it. I am willing to do without the police, but I am not willing to do without you. Everything might happen in your absence. Everything! Everything!&rdquo; she repeated with singular energy. &ldquo;Because, for me, I cannot feel sure as I should, perhaps. Ah, you make me say these things. Such things! But do not go.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
