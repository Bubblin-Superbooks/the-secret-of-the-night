Why then, if you knew he was going to come, didn&rsquo;t you leave me in the bedroom and you watch below yourself?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because so long as I was below he would not have come. He only comes when there is no one downstairs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, Saints Peter and Paul pity a poor woman. Who do you think it is, then? Who do you think it is? I can&rsquo;t think any more. Tell me, tell me that. You ought to know&mdash;you know everything. Come&mdash;who? I demand the truth. Who? Still some agent of the Committee, of the Central Committee? Still the Nihilists?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
