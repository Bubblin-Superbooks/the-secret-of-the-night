Proofs are necessary, and I want the proofs at once. You speak of traces; very well, we will go and examine those traces together. And I wish for your sake, monsieur, that I shall be as convinced by them as you are.&rdquo;</p><p>Rouletabille quietly disengaged his wrist and replied with perfect calm:</p><p>&ldquo;Now, monsieur, I am no longer able to prove anything to you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
