I ran to the governor&rsquo;s house. Trebassof had me thrust away from his door with blows from the butt-ends of his Cossacks&rsquo; guns. And, as I persisted, they kept me locked up all that night and the morning of the next day. At noon I was set free. I demanded my son and they replied they didn&rsquo;t know what I was talking about. But a soldier that I recognized as having arrested my son the evening before pointed out a van that was passing, covered with a tarpaulin and surrounded by Cossacks. &lsquo;Your son is there,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;they are taking him to the graves.&rsquo; Mad with despair, I ran after the van. It went to the outskirts of Golountrine cemetery. There I saw in the white snow a huge grave, wide, deep. I shall see it to my last minute.</p></div> </div>
