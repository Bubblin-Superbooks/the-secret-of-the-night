Ah, it is you the general owes his life to, that Matrena owes her life. Without you this house would already be a coffin. How shall I ever reward you? You wish for nothing! I annoy you! You don&rsquo;t even listen to me! A coffin&mdash;we would all be in our coffins! Tell me what you desire. All that I have belongs to you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I desire to smoke a pipe.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, a pipe!
