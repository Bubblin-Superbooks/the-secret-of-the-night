He once made a long visit to Tolstoi.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bah! Gounsovski must have rendered some signal service to that imprudent prince,&rdquo; concluded Athanase. &ldquo;But for yourself, Thaddeus, you haven&rsquo;t said what you did with Gounsovski at Bakou.&rdquo;</p><p>(Rouletabille did not lose a word of what was being said around him, although he never lost sight of the profile hidden in the black mantle nor of Prince Galitch, his personal enemy,* who reappeared, it seemed to him, at a very critical moment.)</p></div> </div>
