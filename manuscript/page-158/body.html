<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There is not a better man in the world than Feodor, and he must have a good, a very good conscience to dare, without fail, to perform such terrible duties as those at Moscow, when he is so good at heart. These things are easy enough for wicked people, but for good men, for good men who can reason it out, who know what they do and that they are condemned to death into the bargain, it is terrible, it is terrible! Why, I told him the moment things began to go wrong in Moscow, &lsquo;You know what to expect, Feodor. Here is a dreadful time to get through&mdash;make out you are sick.&rsquo; I believed he was going to strike me, to kill me on the spot. &lsquo;I! Betray the Emperor in such a moment! His Majesty, to whom I owe everything! What are you thinking of, Matrena Petrovna!&rsquo; And he did not speak to me after that for two days.</p></div> </div>
