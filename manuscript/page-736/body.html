Very well, then, I am going to say this to you: &lsquo;If I ward off this blow&mdash;if, after having been the unintentional cause of Natacha&rsquo;s arrest, I have the daughter of General Trebassof set at liberty, and that within twenty-four hours,&mdash;what do you say?

She is accused of trying to poison her father and her step-mother, and under such conditions that it seems impossible for human reason to demonstrate the contrary. Natacha Feodorovna herself, crushed by the tragic occurrence, was not able to answer her accusers at all, and her silence has been taken for a confession of guilt.</p></div> </div>
