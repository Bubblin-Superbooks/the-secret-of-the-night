<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t got me yet, the dogs. They haven&rsquo;t got me! And one (he was thinking of Michael) who saw me every day was here just for that. Very well. I ask you where he is now. And yet here I am! An attack! I&rsquo;m always here! But with a good eye; and I begin to have a good leg. We shall see. Why, I recollect how, when I was at Tiflis, there was an insurrection in the Caucasus. We fought. Several times I could feel the swish of bullets past my hair. My comrades fell around me like flies. But nothing happened to me, not a thing. And here now! They will not get me, they will not get me. You know how they plan now to come to me, as living bombs. Yes, they have decided on that. I can&rsquo;t press a friend&rsquo;s hand any more without the fear of seeing him explode. What do you think of that? But they won&rsquo;t get me. Come, drink my health. A small glass of vodka for an appetizer.</p></div> </div>
