<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Only the general&rsquo;s friends that you saw this evening, Natacha and I had entered the general&rsquo;s chamber during the day or in the evening. No servant, no chamber-maid, had been on that floor. In the day-time as well as all night long that entire floor is closed and I have the keys. The door of the servants&rsquo; staircase which opens onto that floor, directly into the general&rsquo;s chamber, is always locked and barred on the inside with iron. Natacha and I do the chamber work. There is no way of taking greater precautions. Three police agents watched over us night and day. The night of the bouquet two had spent their time watching around the house, and the third lay on the sofa in the veranda. Then, too, we found all the doors and windows of the villa shut tight. In such circumstances you can judge whether my anguish was not deeper than any I had known hitherto.</p></div> </div>
