<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes, two. An old one and a new one. One quite new. Why this second hole? Because the old one was judged a little too narrow and they wished to enlarge it, and in enlarging it they broke off the point of a hat-pin in it. Madame, the point is there yet, filling up the little old hole and the piece of metal is very sharp and very bright.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now I understand the examination of the hat-pins. Then it is so easy as that to get through a door with a hat-pin?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing easier, especially if the panel is of pine. Sometimes one happens to break the point of a pin in the first hole. Then of necessity one makes a second. In order to commence the second hole, the point of the pin being broken, they have used the point of a pen-knife, then have finished the hole with the hat-pin.</p></div> </div>
