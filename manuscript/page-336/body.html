Koupriane observed Rouletabille. He dismissed his aide with a gesture. The inspection was over. He drew the young man into a little room just off the dormitory. Rouletabille, frightened, looked about him. He found himself in a chapel. This little chapel completed the effect of the guards&rsquo; dormitory. It was all gilded, decorated in marvelous colors, thronged with little ikons that bring happiness, and, naturally, with the portrait of the Tsar, the dear Little Father.</p><p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Koupriane, smiling at Rouletabille&rsquo;s amazement, &ldquo;we deny them nothing. We give them their saints right here in their quarters.&rdquo; Closing the door, he drew a chair toward Rouletabille and motioned him to sit down. They sat before the little altar loaded with flowers, with colored paper and winged saints.</p></div> </div>
