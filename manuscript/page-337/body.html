I&rsquo;m ready to listen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said Rouletabille, &ldquo;I have come to give you the report of my mission here, and to terminate my connection with it. All that is left for clearing this obscure affair is to arrest the guilty person, with which I have nothing to do. That concerns you. I simply inform you that someone tried to poison the general last night by pouring arsenate of soda into his sleeping-potion, which I bring you in this phial, arsenate which was secured most probably by washing it from grapes brought to General Trebassof by the marshal of the court, and which disappeared without anyone being able to say how.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
