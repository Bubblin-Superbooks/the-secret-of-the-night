I certainly didn&rsquo;t expect to find you here in Pere Alexis&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not, Monsieur Rouletabille? One can find anything here in Pere Alexis&rsquo;s stock. See; here are two old ikons in wood, carved with sculptures, which came direct from Athos, and can&rsquo;t be equaled, I assure you, either at Gastini-Dvor nor even at Stchoukine-Dvor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, that is possible,&rdquo; said Rouletabille, impatiently. &ldquo;Are you an amateur of such things?&rdquo; he added, in order to say something.</p></div> </div>
