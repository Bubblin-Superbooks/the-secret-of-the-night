Come into the dining-room.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah, so someone has told you?&rdquo; said Rouletabille. &ldquo;No, no, thanks; I don&rsquo;t need anything more. You know what has happened?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you had come to dinner, perhaps nothing would have happened at all, you know,&rdquo; said Gounsovski tranquilly, seating himself again on the cushions and considering his game of draughts through his glasses. &ldquo;Anyway, congratulations to Koupriane for being away from there through his fear.&rdquo;</p><p>For Gounsovski there was only Koupriane! The life or death of Trebassof did not occupy his mind. Only the acts and movements of the Prefect of Police had power to move him.</p></div> </div>
