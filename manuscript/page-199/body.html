He paid his compliments to the general, grumbled at his imprudence, praised him for his bravery, and then at once picked out Rouletabille, whom he took aside to talk to.</p><p>&ldquo;You have sent my men back to me,&rdquo; said he to the young reporter. &ldquo;You understand that I do not allow that. They are furious, and quite rightly. You have given publicly as explanation of their departure&mdash;a departure which has naturally astonished, stupefied the general&rsquo;s friends&mdash;the suspicion of their possible participation in the last attack. That is abominable, and I will not permit it. My men have not been trained in the methods of Gounsovski, and it does them a cruel injury, which I resent, for that matter, personally, to treat them this way.</p></div> </div>
