<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Exactly. You understand me and you will understand further when you know that in the garden the first thing that struck me across the face as I went into it was these watchers of the Virgin spun by the dear little spiders of the good God. At first when I felt them on my face I said to myself, &lsquo;Hold on, no one has passed this way,&rsquo; and so I went to search other places. The webs stopped me everywhere in the garden. But, outside the garden, they kept out of the way and let me pass undisturbed down a pathway which led to the Neva. So then I said to myself, &lsquo;Now, has the Virgin by accident overlooked her work in this pathway? Surely not. Someone has ruined it.&rsquo; I found the shreds of them hanging to the bushes, and so I reached the river.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
