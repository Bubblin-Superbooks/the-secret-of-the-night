If it is true that you are not suppressing me in order to avenge Michael Nikolaievitch, then why do you hang me? Why do you inflict this odious punishment on me? Because you accuse me of causing Natacha Feodorovna&rsquo;s arrest? Truly I have been awkward. Of that, and that alone, I accuse myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was you, with your revolver, who gave the signal to Koupriane&rsquo;s agents! You have done the dirty work for the police.&rdquo;</p><p>Rouletabille tried vainly to protest, to explain, to say that his revolver shot, on the contrary, had saved the revolutionaries. But no one cared to listen and no one believed him.</p></div> </div>
