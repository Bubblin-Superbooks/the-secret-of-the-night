<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Natacha, you are going to tell us what Michael Korsakoff came here to do to-night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Feodor Feodorovitch, he came to poison you.&rdquo;</p><p>It was Matrena who spoke now and whom nothing could have kept silent, for she saw in Natacha&rsquo;s attempt at flight the most sinister confession. Like a vengeful fury she told over with cries and terrible gestures what she had experienced, as if once more stretched before her the hand armed with the poison, the mysterious hand above the pillow of her poor invalid, her dear, rigorous tyrant; she told them about the preceding night and all her terrors, and from her lips, by her voluble staccato utterance that ominous recital had grotesque emphasis. Finally she told all that she had done, she and the little Frenchman, in order not to betray their suspicions to The Other, in order to take finally in their own trap all those who for so many days and nights schemed for the death of Feodor Feodorovitch.</p></div> </div>
