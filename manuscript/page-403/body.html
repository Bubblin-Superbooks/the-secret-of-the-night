<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>* as told in &ldquo;The Lady In Black.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was returning from Balakani in a drojki,&rdquo; said Thaddeus Tchitchnikoff, &ldquo;and I was drawing near Bakou after having seen the debris of my oil shafts that had been burned by the Tartars, when I met Gounsovski in the road, who, with two of his friends, found themselves badly off with one of the wheels of their carriage broken. I stopped. He explained to me that he had a Tartar coachman, and that this coachman having seen an Armenian on the road before him, could find nothing better to do than run full tilt into the Armenian&rsquo;s equipage. He had reached over and taken the reins from him, but a wheel of the carriage was broken.&rdquo; (Rouletabille quivered, because he caught a glance of communication between Prince Galitch and Natacha, who was leaning over the edge of her box.)</p></div> </div>
