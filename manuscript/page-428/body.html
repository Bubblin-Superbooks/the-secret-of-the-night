I was so frightened that I couldn&rsquo;t get my purse open. &lsquo;Quicker,&rsquo; said he. Finally I gave him twenty kopecks. &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said he then, &lsquo;kiss my hand.&rsquo; And I had to kiss it, because he held his knife in the other.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, they are quick with their knives,&rdquo; said Thaddeus. &ldquo;As I was leaving Gastinidvor once I was stopped by a hooligan who stuck a huge carving-knife under my nose. &lsquo;You can have it for a rouble and a half,&rsquo; he said. You can believe that I bought it without any haggling. And it was a very good bargain. It was worth at least three roubles. Your health, belle Onoto.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
