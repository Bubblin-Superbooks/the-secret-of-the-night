<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Athanase Georgevitch said:</p><p>&ldquo;There are hooligans that ought to have existed even if they never have. One of them stopped a young girl before Varsovie station. The girl, frightened, immediately held out her purse to him, with two roubles and fifty kopecks in it. The hooligan took it all. &lsquo;Goodness,&rsquo; cried she, &lsquo;I have nothing now to take my train with.&rsquo; &lsquo;How much is it?&rsquo; asked the hooligan. &lsquo;Sixty kopecks.&rsquo; &lsquo;Sixty kopecks! Why didn&rsquo;t you say so?&rsquo; And the bandit, hanging onto the two roubles, returned the fifty-kopeck piece to the trembling child and added a ten-kopeck piece out of his own pocket.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
